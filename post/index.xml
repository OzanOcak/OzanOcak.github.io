      <description>Setting up aarch64 platform within docker container on x86 architecture Docker Desktop for Mac ships with hypervisors for the host OS. The hypervisor is responsible for running a lightweight Linux kernel (LinuxKit), which is included as part of Docker Desktop. This lightweight container OS comes packaged with the QEMU emulator, and comes pre-configured with binfmt_misc to run binaries of any supported architecture. Binfmt_misc is a kernel subsystem which allows to set the magic numbers of a binary file to specific actions for their execution.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
I chose Hugo to this blog and store it in github as a static page. First I install hugo with brew then create 2 seperate github repository; one for all the source codes and the other for staic files in public folder.</description>
